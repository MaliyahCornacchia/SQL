--For this project, I used SQL to query the Superstore database to get information about items sold at the store and their prices. 
select (item_name),(price)--I used a SQL query to order the items by price
From superstore
Order By price;
select sum(price)--I showed a statistic about the item prices
from superstore;
select sum(price)-- I showed a price for items in the category of 'Kitchen Supplies'
From superstore
where category='Kitchen Supplies';
